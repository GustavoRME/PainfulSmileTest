the class name examples will be showed below don't means that will to be used along this project. They just are examples. 

Classes with suffix Component means this classes its used how component, i.e., can be add to the editor of gameobject. (e.g MovementControllerComponent, FireComponent). 

Classes with suffix Behaviour means this classes is inherits from Monobehaviour AND its used how a superclass. (e.g CharacterBehaviour, PlanetBehaviour).
